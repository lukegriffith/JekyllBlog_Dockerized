# Dockerizing the blog

Project: [Trello Link](https://trello.com/b/wbpIL6Fy/dockerize-blog-ci-cd)

Working on moving my blog release pipeline into a Jenkins dockerized workload, from dev to test and finally to deployment.

This will replace my current TeamCity build plan, that pushes everything from master to the S3 bucket
